#How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
Security is a very serious topic that should not be taken lightly, to ensure my code, program, or software is functional and secure I can ensure that objects are declared with appropriate storage durations, avoiding information leakeage anytime a structure is passed accros a boudary, closing files when they are no longer needed, avoiding typical programming vulnerabilities like integer overflow, sensitive data exposure, improper error handling. It is crucial to avoid errors like missing authentication for a critical function, exceution with unnecessary priviledges and not relying on client-sided validation.
